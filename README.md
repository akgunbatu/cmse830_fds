Why you chose your dataset

**I chose this data because I wanted to have a data that I could have related to as a mechanical engineer. I love cars and I always wish to have more money to buy cars. However, I have a budget just like anyone else. I know that there are other car enthusiast that want to get a car but looking for a specific price range. That is why I picked this data, to actaullay enjoy my time while doing this project and also I could feel like I am helping other like me to observe cars with affordable price range.**

What you've learned from IDA/EDA

**From the IDA, I saw that the some columns were not helpful for our price observations like he exterior color. So I have dropped some columns to keep the data neat. While looking at duplicates I realized that there were some cars with the same model and same year but with different prices. I did not know if I needed to drop the duplicates or keep them. After looking more carefully, I realized that the price did not change significantly, so I decided to drop it to observe a much smaller sample size with the still the same correlations and everything. From the correlations I learned that some variables that i thought woul be a good variable did not affect the price at all like the brand popularity. From the visualizations of EDA, I learned that engine horsepower actually increases the price, so the faster the car reaches 0 to 100 mph, the more expensive it gets. Also the younger the car is the more expensive it also gets. I am planning to create other plots where I can see the transmission class distribution and fuel type.**

What preprocessing steps you've completed

**I have cleaned the data, where the data looks much simpler to someone who is not a data science major. I have showed the missing values and showed how imputation affected the dataset itself. I created plots for price to see the correlations for variables that actually affect the price itslef.**

What you've tried with Streamlit so far

**For Streamlit I have tried to install pages, where each page shows a different part of the data cleaning and visualization process. I am thinking about using filters and range for some plots to make the plots more interactive.**
